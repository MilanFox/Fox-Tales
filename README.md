This was a learning project for both Flutter / App Development as well as Google Firebase.
It is no longer being maintained but stying up in case someone finds something of worth in here.
Feel free to explore, modify, and use any code you find here for your own learning and projects.

## Whats the project?

While waiting for our firstborn to arrive I wanted to find out how hard it would be to build a
light social media style / messaging app to safely share videos & images with friends and family.

## Whats the state of the project?

Since I used it as a learning exercise I did finish it to an MVP State, even after deciding to not follow through.
Every function featured in the screenshots does function properly and it is installable on both Android and IOS.

## Why was it discontinued?

Turns out, app development is not fun at all.
And needing to pay 100EUR p.a. just to be able to release it on IOS was the nail in the coffin.

## Features
### Auth

We are using Firebase Authentication to make sure the content can only be accessed by registered users -
only users with "admin" role can register new users.
